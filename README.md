HERE I WILL ONLY BUILD THE FRONT END APPLICATION IN ANGULAR 

This will only be the front end part of the application but ultimately the application will consist of a front end and a rest api to connect with the backend that is build in 
spring with a database to do the crud operations as required by the user.

Now for the requirements : from the Boss

This is what the application must do
1. Show a list of products
2. Add products to shopping cart ( which will require the crud operations)
3. Shopping cart checkout
4. User login/logout security
5. Track previous orders for logged in users

I will import some wireframes for the application

### Homepage ( Basic Layout of our Homepage)
- which will consist of a logo
- a search bar 
- cart items status basket ( Just to indicate to the user what is in his cart)
- Categories 
- Main list items where all of the main items will be listed
- also with pagination 

### Products Page
- which will consist of a logo
- a search bar 
- cart items status basket ( Just to indicate to the user what is in his cart)
- Categories 
- Main Center will have the product details
  - with a image of the product
  - product title , Price etc ( product information)
  - with a brief description of the product

### Shopping Cart details Page
  - which will consist of a logo

  - increase the quantity of the shopping cart
  - decrease 
  - remove items from the shopping cart
  - it will also indicate your subtotals

  - with a checkout button
  
  Checkout Page
